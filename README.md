## Hospital Resource Optimization Dashboard

## Overview
This project explores how **Data Science** can be applied to optimize hospital resources in Jamaica and beyond. This project can be utilized as a system to be further implemented not ensure resources are not wasted and to also ensure that allocation is handled properly. 

The goal is to monitor **patient flow, bed occupancy, and staff allocation** using predictive analytics and interactive dashboards.  

By combining **SQL databases, forecasting models, and visualization tools**, this project demonstrates how hospitals can improve efficiency, reduce overcrowding, and allocate resources more effectively.

## Tools & Technologies
### Data Integration
- **PostgreSQL / MySQL** → store hospital records.
- **FHIR/HL7 Standards** → ensure healthcare data interoperability.

### Forecasting
- **Python**: Prophet, Statsmodels  
- **R**: forecast package (ARIMA, ETS models)

### Dashboards
- **Power BI / Tableau** → interactive dashboards for decision-makers.  
- **Grafana** → real-time monitoring of patient flow and resource usage.
